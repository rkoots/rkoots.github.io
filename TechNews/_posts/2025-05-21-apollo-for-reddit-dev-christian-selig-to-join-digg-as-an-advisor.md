## Apollo for Reddit dev Christian Selig to join Digg as an advisor

The tech world is buzzing with news of Christian Selig, the highly respected iOS developer behind the incredibly popular third-party Reddit client Apollo, joining the revived Digg as an advisor.  This move signifies a significant boost for Digg's ambitious relaunch and highlights the growing influence of independent app developers in the tech landscape.

Selig's Apollo app was renowned for its clean interface, powerful features, and dedicated user base.  Its popularity stemmed from offering a superior user experience compared to the official Reddit app, showcasing the potential for innovation outside of the established platforms.  The app's success was a testament to Selig's design prowess and deep understanding of user needs within the Reddit community.  His departure from active development on Apollo, announced earlier this year, was met with widespread disappointment but also sparked speculation about his future endeavors.  Now, that speculation is answered.

The new Digg, acquired earlier this year by its original founder Kevin Rose and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, aims to recapture its former glory as "the internet's homepage."  This acquisition represented a bold move to revitalize a once-dominant platform.  By bringing Selig onboard as an advisor, Digg is leveraging his expertise in user experience design and mobile app development to guide their product strategy.  Selig's insight into community building and engagement, gleaned from years of experience with the vibrant Reddit community, will be invaluable as Digg attempts to cultivate a similar level of passionate user interaction.

This collaboration is significant not just for Digg but also for the broader tech ecosystem. It demonstrates the increasing value placed on experienced independent developers and the potential for smaller, focused teams to influence the trajectory of larger companies.  The move suggests a shift towards a more collaborative and less siloed approach to product development, particularly in the highly competitive mobile app market. The integration of Selig's design philosophy could potentially influence Diggâ€™s technological direction, possibly leading to innovations in content curation, user interface, and personalization.

While the specifics of Selig's advisory role remain undisclosed, his influence on Digg's future direction promises to be substantial.  This partnership represents a compelling case study in the evolving relationship between established players and innovative independent developers in the tech industry.  It will be fascinating to observe how Selig's influence shapes the development of the new Digg and whether it can successfully reclaim its place in the digital landscape.
