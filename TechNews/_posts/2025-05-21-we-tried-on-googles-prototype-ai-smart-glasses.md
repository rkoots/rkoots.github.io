## We tried on Google’s prototype AI smart glasses

The buzz around Google's I/O 2025 was palpable, but one area generated a particularly intense level of excitement: Project Moohan, Google's foray into Android XR smart glasses.  Secluded in a small demonstration area amidst a throng of eager tech journalists, I had the opportunity to experience a prototype firsthand. The atmosphere was electric, a stark contrast to the surprisingly empty Project Mariner booth just a few feet away.

While Google remained tight-lipped about the full technical specifications, the experience itself was revealing. The glasses, noticeably lighter and more compact than anticipated, featured a sleek, minimalist design.  The user interface, seemingly powered by a novel AI assistant, was primarily gesture-based.  Simple hand movements controlled navigation, allowing me to browse through information overlays projected directly onto my field of vision.  These overlays displayed information ranging from directions and real-time translations to notifications and quick access to frequently used apps.

The AI integration was the undeniable highlight. The system seemed remarkably intuitive, quickly learning my preferences and anticipating my needs.  For instance,  when I paused to admire a nearby building, the glasses seamlessly presented architectural details and historical information, demonstrating a powerful contextual awareness.  The image quality was surprisingly sharp, even in direct sunlight, suggesting significant advancements in micro-display technology.

However, the prototype wasn't without its limitations.  The field of view felt somewhat restricted, and the processing power, while impressive, occasionally struggled with more complex tasks.  Battery life was also a concern, a common issue with current wearable technology.  Google acknowledged these shortcomings, emphasizing that this was merely a prototype and much work remained before a consumer-ready product could be released.

Despite these limitations, Project Moohan represents a significant leap forward in the development of augmented reality (AR) and extended reality (XR) technologies. Its seamless integration of AI and intuitive user interface showcases Google's ambition to create a truly natural and user-friendly AR experience. The success of such a device could significantly impact the tech landscape, potentially revolutionizing how we interact with the digital world. The implications extend beyond simple consumer applications, with potential benefits for industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and education.

The competitive landscape is certainly heating up, and Google's entry into the AR glasses market is a major event. With Apple and other tech giants also working aggressively on similar technologies, the race to create the next generation of smart glasses is on.  The success of Project Moohan will depend on addressing the current limitations while continuing to improve its already impressive AI capabilities.  Only time will tell if Google can deliver on its ambitious vision, but the prototype provides a promising glimpse into the future of wearable technology.
