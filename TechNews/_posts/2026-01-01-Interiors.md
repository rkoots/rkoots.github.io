## Introduction

AI-generated home interior images live or die by prompt quality. Unlike fantasy art, interiors must obey physics, proportions, lighting logic, and basic human taste. Weak prompts produce unusable nonsense. Structured prompts produce design-grade visuals.

## What Makes a Good Home Interior Prompt

A reliable interior prompt always defines:

- **Room type** (living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.)
- **Design style** (modern, Scandinavian, Japandi, luxury)
- **Layout and furniture placement**
- **Lighting direction and temperature**
- **Materials and textures**
- **Image quality modifiers**

Miss one, and the model improvises. Improvisation is how you get floating sofas.
