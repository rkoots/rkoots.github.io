**Buying Advice:**

* **Look for HDR support:**  High Dynamic Range technology delivers greater contrast and color accuracy.
* **Check the refresh rate:**  A higher refresh rate (e.g., 120Hz) is ideal for gaming and fast-paced content.
* **Read reviews:**  Don't solely rely on marketing materials.  Check out independent reviews from reputable sources to get a well-rounded perspective.
