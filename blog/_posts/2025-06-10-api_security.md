# 20 Essential API Security Best Practices Developers Must Follow

Ref: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-essential-tips-api-security-rkoots-ng33c

> **“Your API is only as strong as your weakest security link.”**

APIs are at the core of today’s software — powering mobile apps, web services, and even AI models. But without the right security controls, they can become easy entry points for attackers. Here are **20 critical tips** to secure your API against abuse, breaches, and data leaks.

---

## 🔐 Foundational Security Measures

### 🔹 Use HTTPS
▸ Always use TLS to encrypt data in transit and protect from man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 🔹 Validate Inputs
▸ Sanitize and validate all inputs to defend against injection attacks and malformed data.

### 🔹 Authenticate Users
▸ Use strong authentication methods like OAuth2, JWTs, or API keys — never rely on IP alone.

### 🔹 Use API Keys
▸ Assign unique keys per client, monitor their use, and rotate them regularly.

### 🔹 Implement OAuth2
▸ Use token-based authentication and manage access scopes to limit overexposure.

---

## ⚙️ Access Control & Rate Limiting

### 🔹 Rate Limiting
▸ Prevent abuse and brute-force attempts by setting limits on requests per user/IP.

### 🔹 Data Minimization
▸ Return only what is needed. The less exposed data, the lower the risk.

### 🔹 Avoid Verbose Errors
▸ Don’t reveal system details or stack traces in error messages.

### 🔹 Use CORS Policies
▸ Whitelist only trusted domains for cross-origin access.

### 🔹 Encrypt Stored Data
▸ Protect sensitive data using encryption at rest.

---

## 📊 Logging, Monitoring & Auditing

### 🔹 Log Activity
▸ Maintain logs of API usage, errors, and suspicious behavior — and review them regularly.

### 🔹 Monitor for Threats
▸ Use intrusion detection tools or alerting systems for abnormal request patterns.

### 🔹 Validate Tokens
▸ Ensure all access tokens are current, scoped correctly, and revoked when needed.

---

## 🔐 Restriction and Hardening Techniques

### 🔹 Use IP Whitelisting
▸ Limit access to trusted clients and known networks.

### 🔹 Limit Data Exposure
▸ Apply filters, fields, or scopes to protect sensitive fields from unauthorized access.

### 🔹 Secure Third-Party APIs
▸ Vet and trust all external APIs. Never blindly trust data returned from third parties.

---

## 🔁 Maintenance & Future-Proofing

### 🔹 Version Your APIs
▸ Maintain backward compatibility and plan for future upgrades with versioned endpoints.

### 🔹 Disable Unused Endpoints
▸ Remove deprecated or legacy APIs to reduce attack surfaces.

### 🔹 Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
▸ Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious requests at the edge.

### 🔹 Conduct Regular Audits
▸ Perform periodic reviews to patch vulnerabilities, update libraries, and review access controls.

## 🚀 Pro Tip

> Set up automated alerts and API health dashboards to catch unusual spikes or breaches **before** they cause damage.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

API security is not optional — it's **mission critical**. A single exposed endpoint can cost a company its reputation, customers, and millions in losses. These best practices serve as your first line of defense in building **secure, reliable, and trustworthy APIs**.
