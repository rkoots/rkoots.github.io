**Comedy & Sci-Fi:**

* **[Insert other titles and genres from Wired's list, tailoring the description to include even a hint of tech relevance, e.g., the use of early CGI, the themes of societal control via technology, or the predictive nature of a storyline].**  For example, a comedy might ironically showcase the over-reliance on technology, reflecting a contemporary concern in the tech industry.
