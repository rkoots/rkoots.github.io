## The 13 Best TVs We’ve Reviewed, Plus Buying Advice (2025)

The television has evolved from a simple entertainment device to a sophisticated hub for smart home technology, gaming, and streaming.  In 2025, the market offers a dizzying array of choices, making the selection process challenging. This article highlights 13 of the best TVs we've reviewed, categorized by price point and key features, offering guidance for your next purchase.  Note that specific model numbers and pricing will vary based on region and retailer.


**Understanding the Tech:**

Before diving into our top picks, let's briefly discuss some crucial technological advancements impacting the TV landscape in 2025:

* **Mini-LED & Micro-LED:**  Mini-LED backlights offer improved local dimming capabilities compared to traditional LED TVs, resulting in deeper blacks and higher contrast.  Micro-LED, still relatively nascent but rapidly advancing, promises even superior contrast and brightness with potentially higher resolutions.

* **OLED's Continued Dominance:** OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) technology maintains its position at the high-end, offering perfect blacks and incredible color accuracy.  However, concerns about burn-in remain, though mitigated by advancements in panel technology.

* **Quantum Dot Technology (QLED):** QLED TVs utilize quantum dots to enhance color volume and brightness, offering a compelling alternative to OLED, particularly in brighter rooms.

* **8K Resolution:** While 8K content is still limited, the resolution offers unparalleled detail, making it a future-proof investment for those with discerning eyes and sufficient budget.  However, the jump from 4K is less impactful than the jump from 1080p to 4K was.

* **AI Upscaling & Processing:**  Many modern TVs now incorporate AI to upscale lower-resolution content to near 4K or even 8K quality, improving the viewing experience for older movies and shows. AI also influences features like dynamic contrast and HDR optimization.

* **Gaming Features:**  Low input lag, variable refresh rates (VRR), and HDMI 2.1 are essential features for gamers, ensuring smooth and responsive gameplay.
