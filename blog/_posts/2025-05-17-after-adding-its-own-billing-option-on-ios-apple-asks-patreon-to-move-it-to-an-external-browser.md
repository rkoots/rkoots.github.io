## After adding its own billing option on iOS, Apple asks Patreon to move it to an external browser

Apple's ongoing battle with app developers over in-app purchases and commission fees has taken another turn.  This time, Patreon, the popular creator subscription platform, is caught in the crossfire.  Following Patreon's implementation of its own web-based checkout option for iOS users in the US, Apple has demanded that this functionality be moved to an external browser.

This development highlights the increasingly complex relationship between app stores and the developers who rely on them.  For years, Apple has enforced its stringent in-app purchase rules, requiring developers to use its own payment system and pay a significant commission (typically 30%). This has been a source of contention for many developers, who argue that it stifles innovation and reduces their revenue.

Patreon's recent move represented an attempt to circumvent these fees, offering users a way to subscribe directly through a web-based checkout. While initially successful, this approach appears to have violated Apple's App Store guidelines.  The exact wording of the violation remains unclear, but it's likely related to Apple's rules prohibiting apps from directing users to external payment systems within the app itself.

The impact of Apple's demand on Patreon is significant.  While Patreon can still technically offer its web-based checkout, the user experience will be less seamless.  Users will now be forced to leave the app, navigate to a web browser, complete the payment, and then return to the app. This extra step could lead to user frustration and potentially impact subscription rates.

The wider implications for the tech and startup industries are considerable.  This incident underscores Apple's unwavering control over its App Store ecosystem.  It also raises questions about the fairness and competitiveness of the App Store's policies.  Many smaller developers lack the resources to battle Apple's legal and financial might, leaving them vulnerable to similar demands.

This situation also touches on the ongoing discussion around digital monopolies and the power held by large tech companies.  The debate centers on whether such powerful platforms should be allowed to dictate terms to developers, particularly when it impacts the revenue and user experience of smaller businesses.

The AI industry is indirectly affected as well.  AI-powered tools could potentially help creators manage their Patreon accounts more effectively, but the current environment makes it more challenging for these tools to integrate seamlessly with the platform due to Apple's restrictions.

Patreon's situation is a clear illustration of the power dynamics at play in the mobile app ecosystem.  As Apple continues to evolve its policies, developers must be prepared to adapt and navigate this challenging landscape.  The outcome of this situation will be closely watched by other developers facing similar challenges.
