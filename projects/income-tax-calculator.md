## When to Choose Old Regime vs New Regime?

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

- **Old Regime** is beneficial if you have significant deductions/investments under sections 80C, 80D, 80E, etc.
- **New Regime** suits taxpayers preferring lower tax rates with fewer/no deductions.
- If your total deductions exceed the tax savings from slab benefits in the new regime, old regime may be better.
- If you do not have many investments or deductions, new regime generally leads to lower tax.

**Note:** You can use the Income Tax Calculator to input your exact details and instantly compare which regime benefits you more.
