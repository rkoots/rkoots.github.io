I do not have access to real-time data, including live stock prices, market indices, or news.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested YAML output with current values for Nifty, Bank Nifty, VIX, Put-Call Ratio, FII/DII flows, Fibonacci Retracement levels, and specific gainers and losers.  My knowledge is not connected to live data feeds.

To obtain this information, you should consult reputable financial websites such as the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) website, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) website, or financial news sources like Bloomberg, Reuters, or Yahoo Finance.  These sites will provide you with the up-to-the-minute data you need to populate the YAML structure.


Here's the YAML structure you requested, but remember it's empty because I cannot populate it with live data:

Remember to replace the `null` values with the actual data you gather from reliable financial sources.  I cannot provide a market outlook as I lack access to real-time and historical data necessary for accurate analysis.
