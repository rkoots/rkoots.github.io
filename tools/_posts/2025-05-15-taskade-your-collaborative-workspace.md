> 📌 **Need to inspect YAML files without spinning up a local server?** Here's a minimal yet powerful YAML viewer you can use offline with just your browser.

## 🔧 About the Tool

This tool allows you to load and navigate YAML files directly in your browser — **no server needed**. You can use it to:

- Load structured config files
- Visualize nested YAML as expandable menus
- Quickly debug or inspect values
- Use offline, from any location

## 💡 Key Features

- 🧩 Loads any `.yaml` or `.yml` file via drag-and-drop or file picker
- ⚡ Runs **100% offline** — all in one `index.html`
- 🧠 Supports nested tree structure (e.g., `DB.Credentials.Password`)
- 🔓 Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
