# Recraft.ai : AI design tool for vector graphics, illustrations, and icons

Recraft.ai is a powerful AI-driven design platform for generating high-quality illustrations, icons, UI assets, and branding elements in vector (SVG) format. It combines artistic creativity with artificial intelligence to produce flexible and editable visuals.

**How it Works:**

Simply enter a prompt describing what you want — like “robot reading a book” or “flat design landscape.” Recraft generates multiple image options, editable as SVGs. You can adjust style, format, dimensions, and even refine the output with guided tweaks, making it perfect for designers and non-designers alike.

**Key Features:**

* **AI image generation with control over style and format:** Choose between 2D, 3D, isometric, flat, and more.
* **Export to SVG and PNG:** Fully editable vector files for professional use.
* **Logo, icon, and illustration generator:** Ideal for product mockups and branding.
* **Style consistency controls:** Maintain visual coherence across assets.
* **Easy-to-use interface:** No design skills required.
* **Commercial usage rights:** Use outputs in business or commercial projects.
