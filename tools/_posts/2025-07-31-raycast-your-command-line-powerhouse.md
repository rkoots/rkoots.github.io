## Raycast: Supercharge Your Workflow with AI-Powered Shortcuts

Raycast is a powerful command-line application for macOS that significantly boosts productivity by providing rapid access to frequently used apps, files, and actions. Think of it as a highly customizable, AI-assisted command palette on steroids.  Instead of navigating through numerous menus and windows, you type a few keywords, and Raycast instantly displays relevant results.

Raycast uses a simple, intuitive interface.  You launch the app (using a keyboard shortcut), type your query, and select the desired action from the dynamically updated results.

Extensions further expand its functionality, integrating with various apps and services.
