## Raycast: Supercharge Your Mac Workflow

Raycast is a powerful application launcher and command-line interface (CLI) that aims to dramatically improve your daily workflow on macOS.  Instead of endlessly searching through menus or applications, Raycast lets you type a simple keyword to access files, launch apps, control system settings, run scripts, and much moreâ€”all from a single, easily accessible interface.

**How it Works:**

Raycast uses a combination of pre-built commands and extensibility through plugins and scripts to provide its functionality.  You type a query into the Raycast search bar, and it instantly presents relevant results. This goes beyond simple app launching; you can use it to quickly create new documents, search your notes, control your music, perform system actions, and even interact with third-party services via plugins.  The AI-powered features assist with task prioritization and suggestions.

**Key Features:**

* **Lightning-fast search:** Find anything on your Mac in a fraction of a second.
* **Extensive plugin library:** Expand functionality with hundreds of community-built plugins.
* **Customizable workflows:** Automate repetitive tasks with scripts and extensions.
* **AI-powered suggestions:** Get intelligent recommendations based on your usage.
* **Extension API:**  Allows developers to easily create and share extensions.
