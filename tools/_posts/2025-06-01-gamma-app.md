# Gamma.app : AI-powered presentation & document generator

Gamma.app is a cutting-edge platform that leverages AI to create stunning presentations, documents, and visual stories — without the need for slides or design skills. It blends modern aesthetics with AI generation to make content creation fast, fun, and professional.

**How it Works:**

Users provide an outline or idea, and Gamma generates full presentation decks or web-based documents with rich visuals, layouts, and animations. Unlike traditional slide tools, Gamma outputs a dynamic, scroll-based experience that feels more like a story than a slideshow. Collaboration tools, analytics, and customization options are built in.

**Key Features:**

* **AI-powered slide and document generation:** Turn ideas into full decks in seconds.
* **Beautiful templates and layouts:** Stylish visuals without needing a designer.
* **Web-native format:** Presentations look great on any device.
* **Real-time collaboration:** Co-create with teammates live.
* **One-click publishing and sharing:** Share as a website, doc, or slide deck.
* **Analytics:** See who viewed and engaged with your content.

**Documentation and Links:**

* **Website:** [https://gamma.app/create](https://gamma.app/create)
* **Docs:** (Currently not available — most support is in-app or community-based)

**Reference:**  
Gamma is especially useful for startup founders, educators, marketers, and content creators who need impressive visuals quickly. It reimagines presentations as stories and empowers non-designers to communicate ideas with polish and flair.
