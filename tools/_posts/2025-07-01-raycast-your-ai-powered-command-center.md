## Raycast: Supercharge Your Mac Workflow with AI

Raycast is a powerful and highly customizable command-line application for macOS that leverages AI to streamline your workflow.  Think of it as a supercharged Spotlight search, but with significantly more capabilities.  Instead of just searching your files, Raycast lets you quickly access and interact with numerous apps, services, and functions, all from a single, easily accessible interface.

**How it Works:**

Raycast uses a simple, intuitive interface.  You activate it with a keyboard shortcut (default is `âŒ˜ + Space`), type a keyword, and select from the relevant suggestions that appear.  These suggestions can range from opening specific files and applications to running custom scripts and interacting with various web services.  The AI integration helps to intelligently predict what you need before you even finish typing.

**Key Features:**

* **AI-powered suggestions:**  Raycast anticipates your needs, suggesting relevant commands and actions based on your context and past behavior.
* **Extensive extension library:**  Integrate with countless applications and services through its rich extension ecosystem.
* **Customizable workflows:**  Build powerful custom workflows to automate repetitive tasks.
* **Quick actions:**  Perform many common actions directly within Raycast without launching separate applications.

The best way to learn is through exploration and experimenting with its built-in commands and extensions.
